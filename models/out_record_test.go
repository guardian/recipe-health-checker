Ingredient 'Flaky sea salt' does not specify a quantity, but it is a seasoning so it could be acceptable. However, for consistency, it would be better to specify 'to taste' or a suggested quantity.\n5. Ingredient '1 head garlic' could be clearer by specifying cloves, for example '1 head of garlic, cloves separated'.\n6. Ingredient '0.50 small pomegranate' should not have a decimal point as it's not a standard unit of measurement. It should be 'Â½ small pomegranate'.\n7. The method step 'Fry the shallots for four minutes, shaking the pan a few times.' could be clearer by specifying the oil or fat used for frying.\n8. The method step 'Add the garlic, fry for another minute, until golden-brown, add to the chicken bowl, then combine with the molasses, soy sauce, maple syrup, ginger, oregano sprigs and 50ml water.' is too long and combines multiple steps. It should be broken down into smaller steps.\n9. The method step 'Pour the contents of the bowl into a 26cm x 36cm oven dish or tray and cover tightly with aluminium foil.' does not specify the oven temperature or cooking time, although it mentions roasting in the next step. It would be clearer to include this information with this step.\n10. The method step 'Remove from the oven, stir in the chopped oregano leaves and pomegranate seeds, and serve.' mentions 'chopped oregano leaves', but the ingredients list only includes 'oregano sprigs'.
